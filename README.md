# Developing-Data-Products-Final

PLEASE NOTE: The presentation was produced for the final project of the
Developing Data Products course using shiny. While the gadget does not work within this 
presentation file type, if you run the separate ui and server files, or app 
file, as found in my provided GitHub repository for this assignment, it works 
just fine. This was done because there are current major incompatibility issues 
with both slidify and R Presenter. This is likely because the course was written 
almost 10 years ago with few updates since that time.
